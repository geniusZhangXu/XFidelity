    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how [X Fidelity] (the "App") collects, uses, discloses, and protects your information
        when you use our application. By using the App, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Non - Personal Information</h3>
    <p>App - related Data: We collect data related to the performance and usage of the App, such as crash reports, system
        logs, and usage statistics. This data helps us identify and fix issues, improve the App's functionality, and enhance
        your user experience. For example, crash reports enable us to understand the circumstances under which the App
        malfunctions, allowing us to develop solutions to prevent future crashes.</p>
    <h2>3. Permissions and Their Use</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Camera and Photo Library Permissions</h3>
    <p>Purpose: When you grant the App access to your camera, it is used for features such as in - app photography, which
        may be required for specific functions like creating content within the App. Access to the photo library is used to
        allow you to select existing photos for use in the App, for instance, if you want to add a photo to a project or
        use it for a particular editing task.</p>
    <p>No Data Collection: We do not collect any data from your camera or photo library other than the images you actively
        choose to use within the App's features. The images are only processed locally on your device for the intended
        in - app functions.</p>
    <h3>3.2 Files System App Access</h3>
    <p>Purpose: The App may request access to the Files system App to enable you to access and use files stored on your
        device relevant to the App's functions. For example, if the App has a file - based editing or viewing feature, this
        permission allows you to easily access the required files.</p>
    <p>No Data Collection: We do not collect any information about your files other than the ones you explicitly open or
        interact with within the context of the App's functionality. The App does not scan or collect a list of all your
        files without your active participation.</p>
    <h3>3.3 Microphone and Voice Recognition Permissions</h3>
    <p>Purpose: These permissions are used for features like voice translation. When you use the voice - translation
        function, the App uses the microphone to record your voice, and then the voice recognition technology to translate
        the spoken words.</p>
    <p>No Data Collection: The voice recordings and the data related to voice recognition are only used for the immediate
        translation task within the App. We do not store or collect your voice data for any other purposes.</p>
    <h3>3.4 Location Permission</h3>
    <p>Purpose: The App may access your approximate location when you are using features related to photo - taking in the
        photo library. This is to add location - related metadata to the photos if you choose to enable this feature. For
        example, if you want to mark the location where a photo was taken.</p>
    <p>No Data Collection: We do not collect your location data for any other purpose than adding the optional location
        metadata to the photos you take within the App. Your location data is not shared or used for any other analytical
        or marketing purposes.</p>
    <h3>3.5 Bluetooth Permission for Printer Connection</h3>
    <p>Purpose: When you want to connect the App to a Bluetooth - enabled printer, the App requests Bluetooth permission.
        This allows the App to communicate with the printer and send print jobs.</p>
    <p>No Data Collection: We do not collect any data related to your Bluetooth device other than the necessary
        information for establishing a connection with the printer you have selected to use within the App.</p>
    <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or disclose your personal information to third parties, except as required by law or with
        your explicit consent. The non - personal app - related data we collect may be shared with our service providers who
        assist us in improving the App, such as analytics companies or crash - reporting services. These service providers
        are contractually obligated to keep the data confidential and use it only for the purposes we specify.</p>
    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect the information we collect from unauthorized access, disclosure,
        alteration, or destruction. This includes using industry - standard encryption techniques for data in transit and at
        rest, as well as implementing access controls to limit access to the data to only authorized personnel.</p>
    <h2>6. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the
        updated policy in the App or by sending you a notification within the App. Your continued use of the App after the
        changes are made constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.</p>
